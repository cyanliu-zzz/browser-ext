# WolverineAccess Calendar

Based on personal experiences using WolverineAccess during my semesters as a student at the University of Michigan and going through a silly hassle of trying to make sure my Google Calendar/other calendar applications contain everything I care about.

This extension creates a `.ics` file that contains most relevant information about a given class (the name, section number, type [lecture, discussion, etc.], location, and what days of the week its repeated over). The repeated events also account for the length of the semester and any school breaks.

## How to use the extension:

TBD
