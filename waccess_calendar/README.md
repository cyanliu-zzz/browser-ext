# WolverineAccess Calendar

Based on personal experiences using WolverineAccess during my semesters as a student at the University of Michigan and going through a silly hassle of trying to make sure my Google Calendar/other calendar applications contain everything I care about.

This extension creates a `.ics` file that contains most relevant information about a given class (the name, section number, type [lecture, discussion, etc.], location, and what days of the week its repeated over). The repeated events also account for the length of the semester, any school breaks, and shoudl properly adjust events to account for daylights savings time.

Any issues with this 

## How to use the extension:

TBD
