## Setup instructions

**Chrome**:

1. Go to the Chrome extension page at `chrome://extensions`
2. Toggle "Developer Mode" if it isn't already toggled
3. Select "Load Unpacked", and select the appropriate folder (i.e. the folder this README.md is in)
4. The extension should be enabled by default, but if it isn't, enable it with the little toggle button.
5. Browse the internet with your newfound glory.

**Firefox**:
1. Go to the Firefox debugging page at `about:debugging`
2. Check the `Enable add-on` debugging box
3. Click `Load Temporary Add-on`
  * Note you'll need to do this every time you reopen the browser
  * You can avoid this by using the Firefox developer browser instead
4. Select a file *within* the folder; it can be this README.md
