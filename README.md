# extensions

A collection of folders (because at the time I didn't know submodules were a thing) of browser extensions that all do one very minute job questionably well.

The idea was inspired after completing my senior capstone course during the spring semester of 2018 and realizing that browser extensions were a lot of fun to make :)
